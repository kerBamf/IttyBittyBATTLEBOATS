ITTY BITTY BATTLE BOATS!!!

## User Story

In this game, the user will being playing a modified game of battleship. There will be two grids, side-by-side, a player grid and an enemy grid. At the beginning of the game, the user will choose a set number of tiles to place their battle boats. The computer will do the same thing. When play begins, whoever gets to go first will be chosen at random. Both the computer and the player will have one 'action' per turn, either "sighting" or "firing." The player "sights" by clicking on a blank tile on the enemy grid. If there is no boat on that tile, the tile will remain unmarked. This is adding a memory aspect to the game, though this could be changed based on how gameplay feels. If a player clicks on a tile occupied by a boat, the boat will be "sighted," with the tile changing color (or some other effect) as an indicator. On their next turn, the player can choose to attempt to "sight" another enemy boat or "fire" on an enemy boat by clicking on an occupied tile. A ship must be "fired" upon until its HP runs out (value could be changed if the game takes too long.) Once either all of the computer's boats or all of the player's boats are sunk, the game is over. Some text will appear on the screen proclaiming the winner, and a button will appear asking if the user would like to play again.

User-experience stretch features:
    -When first loading the game, a timed 'splash page' will flash the name of the game before revealing the full UI
    -When 'sighting,' add a fadeout effect to the tile clicked on by the player.

## Stretch Mechanics
    Defense Shield: If a player's boat is fired upon, allow them to take their next action to "shield" that boat, effectively increasing its HP
    Fleet Firepower: If the player (and computer) have above a certain number of boats remaining, each "fire" action deals added damage.
